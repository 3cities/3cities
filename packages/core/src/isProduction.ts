//  TODO split isProduction into two different dimensions with four vars, 1. isMainnetDependencies (isTestnetDependencies = !isMainnetDependencies) and 2. isProductionEnvironment (isDevelopmentEnvironment = !isProductionEnvironment) --> see .env-cmdrc.js --> then, update some usages of today's isProduction to instead be isMainnetDependencies. For example, token/chains should be mainnet based on isMainnetDependencies and not isProduction. For example, the "Open Link" dev feature in Request Money should use isDevelopmentEnvironment --> this change allows our three environments (dev, prod-test, prod) to properly configure themselves (eg. today prod-test has isProduction=false but instead it should have isMainnetDependencies=false isProduction=true)

// isProduction is true if and only if the app is being run in production mode, ie. against production dependencies, eg. to use blockchain mainnets instead of testnets. Note that whether or not the app is being run in production mode (ie. the truthiness of isProduction) is orthogonal to the type of build being used to run the app. The app may be run with isProduction==true while in built in development mode (eg. to debug locally against production dependencies), or the app may be run with isProduction==false in a production minified build (eg. to offer a production deployment against test dependencies for demo purposes)
export const isProduction: boolean = process.env['REACT_APP_IS_PRODUCTION'] === 'true';
