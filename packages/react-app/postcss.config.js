// WARNING create-react-app doesn't actually use this file. Instead, the react-scripts package will auto-detect the use of tailwind by the existence of tailwind.config.js, and then create-react-app has its own baked-in list of postcss plugins used in the build. To make this work with tailwindcss/nesting, I forked create-react-app and updated this list of plugins to those recommended by tailwind's Adam Wathan https://github.com/ryanberckmans/create-react-app/releases/tag/postcss-tailwind-fix-v0.1
module.exports = {
  plugins: {}
}
