3cities is a tool to pay and get paid on Ethereum.

3cities is not a wallet, it's an app that lets you connect your wallet.

3cities is not a token or a chain, it's an app that automatically searches the payment sender's wallet for the best payment method across ten popular tokens and a dozen L2s.

Individuals can use 3cities to send or receive payments, donations, transfers, or deposits.

Merchants can use 3cities to be accept transactional payments and self-process those payments offchain (be your own payment processor). Payments can be in USD or ETH, with EUR and other currencies soon to come.
